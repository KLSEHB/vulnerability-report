DVWA v1.0(https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-39848) via the id parameter at blind\source\high.php.

5.	 $id = $_COOKIE[ 'id' ];
6.	
7.	 // Check database
8.	 $getid  = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id' LIMIT 1;";
9.	 $result = mysqli_query($GLOBALS["___mysqli_ston"],  $getid ); // Removed 


When a user stores malicious input in the cookie, the variable $id receives the value of $_COOKIE['id'] and is directly passed into the $query, 
resulting in the risk of data loss and unauthorized access. For example, if an attacker hijacked the cookie and stores a malicious value "12 or 1=1 #" in the cookie. 
Once the above code is triggered, the generated SQL statement becomes "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = 12 or 1=1 # LIMIT 1", 
where # acts as a comment symbol, causing the subsequent statements to not be executed, and "or 1=1" becomes a constant true condition, leading to data leakage from the users table.
